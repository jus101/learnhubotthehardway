# Learn Hubot the Hard Way

Learn how to install, configure and even contribute to hubot.

## Description

Learn Hubot the Hard Way is an independently written book about hubot. I chose
to write the book because I want to help more people and companies deploy and
use hubot to automate mundane tasks and create a more relaxed and fun working
environment.

I would also love to see many more people contribute scripts to the hubot
scripts repository. Even maybe contribute to the core of hubot as well. So the
late chapters of the book are dedicated to helping people learn how to write
their own scripts and how the internals of hubot actually work.
